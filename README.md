# Fourier-Visualizer
This project is meant to give some visual intuition on the 2-dimensional Fourier Transformation.

Running spectrum.py and inverse-spectrum.py requires you have the cv2, numpy, and pygame libraries installed. If you don't, go to terminal and use the commands:
- pip install opencv-python
- pip install numpy
- pip install pygame

Lastly, you may need to edit the 'current-folder' and 'save-folder' variables appropriately.

Specific details on ways you can interact with the program are listed at the top of each file.

## weave.py
Unrelated to the Fourier transform but thought I might put it in the project since it uses the same images. Lets you 'weave' two images together pixel by pixel or, by changing the block-size variable, in larger strips. Output images are fairly interesting.
